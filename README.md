**Learn C++ at University of Glasgow**


This repo is developed by heavily using [www.learncpp.com](www.learncpp.com). However, the repo does not try to compile the website into a single book.

# Contents
The repo is divided into the following sections: 

1. **Section 01**: C++ Basics
2. **Section 02**: C++ Intermediate
3. **Section 03**: Object-oriented Programming in C++
4. **Section 04**: UML Class Diagrams. 

Each section corresponds to one folder and contains multiple chapters that cover various topics in C++ programming. Each chapter in one sepcfic section is numbered sequentially. Note that chapter numbers in Section 02 continue from the last chapter number in Section 01, and so on for Section 03 and Section 04.

**REMARK**  
It can be debatable when the contents in two sections "C++ basics" and "C++ intermediate" should not be considered separate as they are all actually foundational in C++. However, for educational purpose, I want to separate the contents in these two sections for two reasons:

- It is easier for the students to follow, and to structure the course Moodle to reflect the GitHub materials.
- The content in Section "C++ Intermediate" is only available and not relevant in Python programming that is taught in Year 2. They involve sophisticated topics such as pointers, reference, pass by value, pass by reference, pass by address, lvalue, rvalue. In fact, Python has something like "pass an immutable object" that feels like _pass by value_ and "pass a mutable object" that feels like _pass by reference_.
