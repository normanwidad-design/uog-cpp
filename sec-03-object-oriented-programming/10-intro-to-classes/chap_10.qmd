# Why Object-Oriented Programming

## Procedure programming vs Object-oriented programming
- Up to now, we've been doing a type of programming called [**procedure programming**]{style="color:red"}. In procedure programming, the functions and the data those functions operate on are separate entities.

- In [**object-oriented programming**]{style="color:red"} (OOP), the focus is on creating program-defined data types that contain both properties and a set of well-defined behaviors.

We won't discuss why we need Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) in this course:

- We have all learned the importance of OOP in "Introductory Programming 2" and other programming courses.
- [Since the 1990s, OOP has been the industry standard.]{style="color:navy"}

<u>Instead, I walk you through some job posts in software engineer industry.</u>



## The dominance of OOP

- [**Why it's popular**]{style="color:navy"}: It mimics how we perceive the world -- objects with properties and behaviors.
- [**Scalable**]{style="color:navy"}: OOP makes it possible to manage large, complex systems where we need to "encapsulate" data to prevent bugs.
- [**The industry "lungs"**]{style="color:navy"}: If you look at job postings or legacy codebases, [OOP is everywhere.]{style="color:navy"}

_You don't need to know MATLAB to find a job in Mathworks_. [Instead, you need experience in C++ and OOP.]{style="color:red"}

## C++ is highly desired in industry

I asked Gemini about software engineering roles at MathWorks (developing MATLAB you use all the time.)

## C++ is highly desired in industry: Software architecture at Airbus

## Git Control and OOP are essential skills in industry
Note the requirement of experience with Java. For your record, [Java is a pure OOP programming language]{style="color:red"}.

## Why OOP

::: {.my-box}
_I hope this is more than enough to convince you why we need to learn Object-Oriented Programming, especially in C++._

# `struct` vs `class`

**Importance Note** 


:::{.my-box}
[_In C++, the difference between a `struct` and a `class` is surprising small from a technical standpoint_]{style="color:red"}, but quite significant from a **stylistic** and **architecture** standpoint.
:::

- Therefore, any example that is implemented using a struct could be implemented using a class, or vice-versa. 
- However, from a practical standpoint, we use `struct` and `class` differently.

## `struct` vs `class`: Technical difference (defaults)

In C++, a `struct` and a `class` are almost identical, except for the default access level of their members and inheritance. That's it!

**Default Access Control**

- `struct`: Members (variables and functions) are `public` by default
- `class` : Members are `private` by default
  
**Default Inheritance**

- `struct`: Inherits `publicly` by default
- `class` : Inherits `privately` by default

We shall study these concepts soon.

## `struct` vs `class`: Google C++ style

Technically, you can use `struct` and `class` interchangably. Practically, we use them with different purposes. Google suggests

## `struct` vs `class`: Google C++ style

**Key points**

- Use a `struct` only for passive objects that carry data; everything else is a `class`.
- The `struct` and `class` keywords behave almost identically in C++. We add our own semantic meanings to each keyword, so you should use the appropriate keyword for the data-type you're defining.

# Defining a class: Syntax

## Defining a class

- A class is a **program-defined** data type. Sometimes, you hear **user-defined** data type.
- Classes are defined similarly to structs: Classes are defined using the `class` keyword, structs using the `struct` keyword.

```{.cpp}
class Employee
{
    int m_id {};            // m_ stands for member, m_id is the member variable
    int m_age {};
    double m_wage {};   
}
```

**Naming convention**

&#10149;&nbsp; The prefix `m_` is used to signify the member variables of a class.

&#10149;&nbsp; We discuss why member variables of a class are often prefixed with an `m_` in upcoming lesson.

## Naming convention: Google style

![](./figures/google-class-data-members-naming-convention.png)

## Naming convention: Which to choose


- Several companies and wide industry adopt the prefix `m_` naming convention.
    
    ```{.cpp}
    class Employee
    {
        int m_id {};
        int m_age {};
        double m_wage {};   
    }
    ```
- Google suggests trailing underscore, such as `id_`, `age_`, and `wage_`
  
    ```{.cpp}
    class Employee
    {
        int id_ {};
        int age_ {};
        double wage_ {}
    }
    ```

&#10149;&nbsp; We'll use the prefix `m_` convention as intelliSense will suggest variable names when we type `m_`.

## A `class` can implement a `struct`

By declaring `public` member variables, a `class` behaves just like a `struct`.

::: {#lst-class-like-struct lst-cap="A `class` behaves like a `struct` by declaring member variables `public`. Filename=`class_just_like_struct.cpp`"}
```{.cpp}
{{< include ./cpp/class_just_like_struct.cpp >}}
```
:::

## Most of the C++ standard library is classes

We have already been using class objects, perhaps without knowing it:

- `std::string`
- `std::string_view`
- `std::vector`

In fact, most of the non-aliased types in the standard library are defined as classes!

::: {.my-box}
Classes are really the heart and soul of C++ -- they are so foundational that C++ was originally named “C with classes”!
:::

# Member functions

## Member functions
- In addition to having member variables, `class` types (which include `struct`, `class`, `union`) can have their own functions.
- Functions that belong to a class type are called [**member functions**]{style="color:red"}.
- Functions that are not member functions are called [**non-member functions**]{style="color:red"}.

## A member function example

In this lesson, we'll use strucuts to show examples of member functions -- but everything we show here applies equally well to classes.

::: {#lst-class-like-struct lst-cap="An example of member function. Filename=`member_function_example.cpp`"}
```{.cpp}
{{< include ./cpp/member_function_example.cpp >}}
